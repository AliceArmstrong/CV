## Summary

Until the end of 2016, I was the manager of a successful electronics retail store. Seeking a change in life, I started teaching myself how to code and joined Makers Academy, an intensive software developer training course. This led to me working at Mettrr, where over the past two years I've helped the company grow from a tech team of around 14 to a team of around 25 developers. My primary experience at Mettrr has been building new features for software in JavaScript and PHP. I use my spare time to try to enrich the tech industry by talking about tech in schools and organising various talks nights, as well as attending tech conferences and workshops.

## Skills

#### People Management

Several years management experience has seen me in charge of teams of up to 10 in a day with full rotas of around 20 people in my largest store. People are the backbone of any business, and as such, effective people management has been a crucial skill for me to develop. The following are examples of skills I've particularly honed:

* Training and Development
* Time Management and Delegation
* Disciplinary Procedure
* Wage and Stock Control
* Commercial Awareness


#### Drive for Success

In 2015, I took the risk of leaving my store in Staffordshire to take over a failing store in Fulham with many known problems. In three months, I had completely re-trained the staff and subsequently raised the average sales of the store by Â£2k a week, delivering the best quarter the store had seen for around 3 years. I owe this to my drive and determination to succeed in difficult situations. On a similar note, it's estimated that over 1000 hours of coding are completed over the 16 weeks of Makers Academy. It's an intensive experience that requires one to give up every evening and weekend for four months, and thus requires a strong drive for success to undertake.
