Until the end of 2016, I was the manager of a successful electronics retail store. Seeking a change in life, I started teaching myself how to code and joined Makers Academy, an intensive software developer training course. This led to me landing my first developer job at Mettrr, a rapidly expanding web design start-up. When not working, I enjoy attending workshops and conferences on interesting new technologies. I also support diversity in tech in my spare time, and have recently been interviewed by the BBC for a piece on encouraging females into the industry.

## Skills

#### Creative Technology

Whether art, music or technology, I have always loved creating. I was first introduced to coding at a young age via QBasic, and enjoyed spending much of my youth creating simple text adventure games and scripts. Moving to London and discovering Makers Academy has since allowed me to turn this hobby into a marketable skill and has given me the tools I need to keep developing these skills in a workplace environment. Below are some example skills that I've developed:

* Pair-Programming
* Test-Driven Development
* Agile Development
* Object-Oriented Design
* XP Values (Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage)

#### People Management

Several years management experience has seen me in charge of teams of up to 10 in a day with full rotas of around 20 people in my largest store. People are the backbone of any business, and as such, effective people management has been a crucial skill for me to develop. The following are examples of skills I've particularly honed:

* Training and Development
* Time Management and Delegation
* Disciplinary Procedure
* Wage and Stock Control
* Commercial Awareness

#### Adaptability

Though my current role is primarily front end JavaScript, I have created projects in multiple languages and frameworks. One major advantage of the training I have received at Makers Academy is the ability to learn new technologies incredibly quickly. This is demonstrated through my final project, which was an Alexa Skills app for the Amazon Echo, a medium quite different to the Makers Academy syllabus. I also have experience with Photoshop and Sketch, with an interest in UX/UI.

#### Drive for Success

In 2015, I took the risk of leaving my store in Staffordshire to take over a failing store in Fulham with many known problems. In three months, I had completely re-trained the staff and subsequently raised the average sales of the store by Â£2k a week, delivering the best quarter the store had seen for around 3 years. I owe this to my drive and determination to succeed in difficult situations. On a similar note, it's estimated that over 1000 hours of coding are completed over the 16 weeks of Makers Academy. It's an intensive experience that requires one to give up every evening and weekend for four months, and thus requires a strong drive for success to undertake.
