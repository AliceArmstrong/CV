## Alice Armstrong

Previously, I was the manager of a successful electronics retail store. I am now using the drive and determination I gained from that to learn new skills and develop existing ones at Makers Academy. I'm hoping to apply these skills in a company that loves technology as much as I do.

## Skills

#### Creative Technology

Whether art, music or technology, I have always loved creating. I was first introduced to coding at a young age via QBasic, and enjoyed spending much of my youth creating simple text adventure games and scripts. Moving to London and discovering Makers Academy has since allowed me to turn this hobby into a marketable skill and has given me the tools I need to keep developing these skills independently once my time studying has ended. Below are some example skills that I've developed:

- Ruby
- Rspec
- Pair-Programming
- Test-Driven Development

#### People Management

Several years management experience has seen me in charge of teams of up to 10 in a day with full rotas of around 20 people in my largest store. People are the backbone of any business, and as such, effective people management has been a crucial skill for me to develop. The following are examples of skills I've honed profusely:

- Training and Development
- Time Management and Delegation
- Disciplinary Procedure
- Wage control

#### Independent Development
Being the manager of my store, there would be no presence of any more senior management during my day-to-day work. This means that the performance of my store relied purely on my own independent motivation, judgement and personal development. Similarly, the work at Makers Academy hinges on the ability to learn independently and develop skills in your own time.
